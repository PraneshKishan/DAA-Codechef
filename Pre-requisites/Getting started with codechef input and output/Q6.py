# What are test cases
# In the previous problem - we wrote the program to accept inputs on a single line.
# But each problem had only 1 test case.

# What will we do if we expect 100 inputs or test cases?
# What about 100,000 inputs or test cases?
# Task
# Lets solve a simple problem.
# Write a program in the IDE which does the following

# Accepts the count of test cases - 
# t
# t - as an integer input given in the 1st line.
# This is followed by 
# t
# t lines - Each line contains an integer 
# N
# N
# For each test cases, prints out the integer 
# N
# N to console on a separate line (our Input mirror problem

#Answer

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):     

    N = int(input())         

    print(N)
