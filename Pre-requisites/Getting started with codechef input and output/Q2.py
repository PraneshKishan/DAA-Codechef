# How to accept integer inputs
# In the previous problem, we saw that input() assumes the input to be of type string.

# Task
# Let us define a variable N that accepts integer inputs.
# Output the same variable 
# To convert the input into an integer, we use the int() function.

# Code the solution in the IDE and then click Submit to continue.

N = int(input())
print(N)
