Time complexity for DSA
Let’s look at another algorithm, 
which calculates the sum of all the pairs (i, j) where 1 <= i <= N and 1 <= j <= N.

sum = 0
for i = 1 to N
     for j = 1 to N
          sum += i
          sum += j

Can this algorithm run within a second if the constraints on N are: 1≤N≤10^5?

Answer: No
